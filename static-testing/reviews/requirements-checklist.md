# Checklist: Requirements Specification Review
> **Category:** Static Testing 

---

##  :bulb: Organization and Completeness
- [ ] Are all internal cross-references to other requirements correct?
- [ ] Are all requirements written at a consistent and appropriate level of detail?
- [ ] Do the requirements provide an adequate basis for design?
- [ ] Is the implementation priority of each requirement included?
- [ ] Are all external hardware, software, and communication interfaces defined?
- [ ] Have algorithms intrinsic to the functional requirements been defined?
- [ ] Does the specification include all of the known customer or system needs?
- [ ] Is the expected behavior documented for all anticipated error conditions?

## 🎯  Correctness
- [ ] Do any requirements conflict with or duplicate other requirements?
- [ ] Is each requirement written in clear, concise, unambiguous language?
- [ ] Is each requirement verifiable by testing, demonstration, review, or analysis?
- [ ] Is each requirement in scope for the project?
- [ ] Is each requirement free from content and grammatical errors
- [ ] Is any necessary information missing from a requirement? If so, is it identified as TBD?
- [ ] Can all of the requirements be implemented within known constraints?
- [ ] Are any specified error messages unique and meaningful?

## 🔒 Quality Attributes
- [ ] Are all performance objectives properly specified?
- [ ] Are all security and safety considerations properly specified?
- [ ] Are other pertinent quality attribute goals explicitly documented and quantified, with the acceptable
tradeoffs specified?

## 🔗 Traceability
- [ ] Is each requirement uniquely and correctly identified?
- [ ] Is each software functional requirement traceable to a higher-level requirement (e.g., system
requirement, use case)?

## ⚠️ Special Issues
- [ ] Are all requirements actually requirements, not design or implementation solutions?
- [ ] Are all time-critical functions identified, and timing criteria specified for them?
- [ ] Have internationalization issues been adequately addressed?
