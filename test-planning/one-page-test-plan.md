## 📖 Introduction
[cite_start]This plan outlines the basic approaches to testing the **OpenWeatherMap** web application[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Additional project information is available at [openweathermap.org/about](https://openweathermap.org/about)[cite: 1].

## 🎯 Goals
1. [cite_start]**API Testing:** Execute comprehensive testing of the OpenWeatherMap API[cite: 1].
2. [cite_start]**Test Documentation:** Create a Checklist and a Test Report based on the API testing results[cite: 1].

## 🏗️ Scope
* [cite_start]**In Scope:** API testing (available at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api))[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Out Of Scope:** Performance, UI, Functional, Security, and Load testing[cite: 1].

## ⚠️ Risks
* [cite_start]Network Issues[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Software Issues[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Time Constraints[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Challenges with the definition of correct requirements[cite: 1].

## ⚙️ Environments & Tools
* [cite_start]**Operating System:** Microsoft Windows 7+[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Browsers:** Chrome (latest version), Firefox (latest version)[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Source Control (SVC):** GitHub[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**API Testing Tools:** REST, Postman, Restlet Client, JSON[cite: 1].

## 🏁 Criteria

### Entry Criteria
* [cite_start][ ] Requirements and test goals are clearly defined for testers[cite: 1].
* [cite_start][ ] All test environments and tools are ready for use[cite: 1].
* [cite_start][ ] Test data and documentation are available[cite: 1].
* [cite_start][ ] The Checklist is prepared and ready for execution[cite: 1].

### Exit Criteria
* [cite_start][ ] Allocated test time has concluded[cite: 1].
* [cite_start][ ] At least **85%** of all test scenarios from the Checklist have passed[cite: 1].
* [cite_start][ ] The Test Report is finalized and provided to stakeholders[cite: 1].

## 👥 People
* [cite_start]**QA Engineer:** Zhdan Alexander[cite: 1].

## 📅 Schedule and Estimations

### 🛡️ Importance for a Test Analyst
As a **Test Analyst**, this document serves several critical functions:
* [cite_start]**Defining Boundaries:** Clearly stating what is "Out of Scope" (e.g., Performance or Security) protects you from "scope creep" and unrealistic expectations[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Quantitative Quality (Exit Criteria):** Setting a **85% pass rate** provides a measurable definition of "done," allowing for objective quality assessment instead of subjective guessing[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Resource Planning:** By estimating specific days for analysis versus execution, you ensure that the testing phase isn't squeezed at the end of the development cycle[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Risk Awareness:** Explicitly identifying risks like "Issues with requirements" allows you to flag potential blockers to stakeholders before they impact the schedule[cite: 1].
